## F.A.Q.

### Is a game missing?

This visualization only shows Switch 2 games that are _published_ by Nintendo. Not all Switch 2 exclusives are published by Nintendo.

Nintendo has updated a number of Switch 1 games to make them look, run, and play better on Switch 2. These games are not included in the visualization. You can see the full list of these games [on Nintendo’s website](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/).

Nintendo will continue to release new Switch 1 games that can be played on Switch 2 but will not be included in the visualization.

### What does “Plain” mean?

“Plain” refers to the upgrade from Switch 1 to Switch 2. It means that there aren’t many differences between the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions of the game. The “Switch 2 edition” looks and runs better, and contains a few extra features.

Whether some of these games are truly Switch 1 games that have been upgraded to Switch 2, or actually Switch 2 games that have been downgraded to Switch 1 is a matter of opinion.

### Does scrolling with the mouse not work?

Since the page scrolls horizontally instead of vertically, you need to hold down the Shift key while rolling the mouse wheel to scroll the page.
