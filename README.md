## F.A.Q.

### Is a game missing?

This visualization only shows Switch 2 games that are _published_ by Nintendo. Not all Switch 2 exclusives are published by Nintendo.

Nintendo has updated a number of Switch 1 games to make them look, run, and play better on Switch 2. These games are not included in the visualization. You can see the full list of these games [on Nintendo’s website](https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/).

Nintendo will continue to release new Switch 1 games that can be played on Switch 2 but will not be included in the visualization.

### What does “Plain” mean?

“Plain” refers to the upgrade from Switch 1 to Switch 2. It means that there aren’t many differences between the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions of the game. The “Switch 2 edition” looks and runs better, and contains a few extra features.

Whether some of these games are truly Switch 1 games that have been upgraded to Switch 2, or actually Switch 2 games that have been downgraded to Switch 1 is a matter of opinion.

### Does scrolling with the mouse work?

Yes, it does. You can scroll normally with the mouse wheel.
